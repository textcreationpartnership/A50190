            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>HONO<g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>RED SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have received yours, wherein you de≈øire me to give you a Brief
Account of the pa≈øt and pre≈øent State of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which in as
few words as I can, and as ≈øtraits of time will permit me, I ≈øhall
endeavour your Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New England</hi> contains that Tract of Land which is between
forty and forty five Degrees of Northern Latitude; It was for ≈øome time known
by the name of the <hi>Northern Plantation;</hi> but King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Fir≈øt (then Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>) gave it the name of <hi>New
England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fir≈øt ≈øettlement of the Engli≈øh there, was in the year
1620, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>New Plymouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>New England</hi> differs from other Foreign Plantations, in
re≈øpect of the Grounds and Motives, inducing the Fir≈øt Planters to remove
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101219:3"/>into that <hi>American</hi> De≈øert; other Plantations were
built upon Worldly Intere≈øts, <hi>New England</hi> upon that which is purely
Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; for although they did, and do agree (as is evident from their
Printed Confe≈ø≈øion of Faith) with all other <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches;</hi> and more e≈øpecially with <hi>England,</hi> in Matters of
Doctrin, and in all Fundamental Points of Faith; yet as to the Liturgy,
Ceremonies, and Church-Government by Bi≈øhops, they were, and are
<hi>Non-conformi≈øts:</hi> It was grievous to them to think of living in
continual difference with their Prote≈øtant Brethren in <hi>England;</hi> upon
which account they re≈øolved on a peaceable SECESSION into a corner of the
World; and being de≈øirous to be under the Protection of <hi>England,</hi>
about twenty worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men obtained a Charter from King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fir≈øt, bearing date from the year 1628. which giveth them Right to the
Soil, for they hold their Titles of Lands, as of the Mannor of
<hi>Ea≈øt-Greenwich</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and in Common SOCAGE, which,
notwith≈øtanding, they purcha≈øed their Lands of the Indians, who were the
Native Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors: By their mentioned Charter, they are Empower'd to Elect
yearly their own Governor, and Deputy-Governor, and Magi≈øtrates, as here in
<hi>London,</hi> and in other Towns Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the Freemen chu≈øe their Lord
Mayors, Mayors, Aldermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have al≈øo Power to make ≈øuch Laws, as ≈øhall be mo≈øt
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ≈øuitable for the Plantation: Neverthele≈øs, as an
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of <hi>their dependance on England,</hi> by their Charters,
they are obliged not to make any Laws, which ≈øhall be repugnant to the Laws
in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Al≈øo, the fifth part of all <hi>Oar,</hi> of Gold or Silver,
found in that Territory, belongs to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Report of this Charter, did encourage many very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving
per≈øons to Tran≈øplant them≈øelves, and their Families, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>New
England;</hi> Gentlemen of Ancient and Wor≈øhipful Families, and Mini≈øters
of the Go≈øpel, then of great fame here in <hi>England,</hi> Trade≈ømen,
Artificers, and Planters, to the Number of about four thou≈øand did in twelve
years time go thither.</p>
            <p>The hazards they run, and the difficulties which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
with, in ≈øubduing a Wilderne≈øs, cannot be ea≈øily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øt in a large
Tract: But the Almighty God, by a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providence, carried them through
all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101219:3"/>In the year 1637, they were in imminent danger
of being cut off by the barbarous Heathen; but when it came to a War, mighty
numbers of the Indians were ≈ølain, by a few of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh, which cau≈øed
a terror of God to fall upon the Heathen round about; ≈øo that after the
<hi>Pequod</hi> Indians were ≈øubdued, there was peace in the Land for forty
eight years together; and being ≈øetled under a good and ea≈øie Government,
the Plantation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed, and pro≈øpered wonderfully; yea, ≈øo as cannot
be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled in any Hi≈øtory: never was place brought to ≈øuch a
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderablene≈øs in ≈øo ≈øhort a time; that which was, not long ≈øince,
a howling Wilderne≈øs, in few years time, became a plea≈øant Land, wherein
was abundance of all things meet for Soul and Body, which can be imputed to
nothing el≈øe, but to their Religion, the Go≈øpel bringing a fulne≈øs of
Ble≈ø≈øings along with it: Some have ob≈øerved, that ≈øince the year 1640,
more Per≈øons have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of <hi>New England,</hi> than have gone
thither. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈øs, the four thou≈øand, who did, between that and the
year 1620, tran≈øplant them≈øelves into <hi>New England,</hi> are ≈øo
mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velou≈øly increa≈øed, as that, if the Computation fail not, they are now
become more than Two hundred thou≈øand Souls.</p>
            <p>There are Towns and Villages, on the Sea-Coa≈øts, from <hi>Long
I≈øland</hi> to <hi>Bo≈øton,</hi> which is Three hundred Engli≈øh Miles, and
the like from <hi>Bo≈øton</hi> to <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> which is Two hundred
Miles more.</p>
            <p>In the year 1662, <hi>Conecticot</hi> Colony, as al≈øo <hi>Read
I≈øland,</hi> with the Plantations thereunto belonging, had Charters granted
to them by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, being much of the ≈øame Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
with the Patent of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øets,</hi> whereby the≈øe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
were made di≈øtinct Government.</p>
            <p>In the year 1675, the Indians began a ≈øecond War with the
Engli≈øh; the I≈ø≈øue of which was, that whole Nations of them were
de≈øtroy'd.</p>
            <p>Never did men ≈øhew greater Courage and Bravery in their
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters with the Barbarous Heathen, than they did. Although it mu≈øt be
acknowledged that the <hi>Indians</hi> advantages were ≈øuch, as they could
not have been overcome, if God had not fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them, by ≈øending the
Evil Arrows of Famine, and Mortal Di≈øea≈øes among them. I have often thought
of an Expre≈ø≈øion of<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101219:4"/>an Indian there: <hi>We could ea≈øily
be too hard for the Engli≈øh, but</hi> (≈øaid he? ≈øtriking on his Brea≈øt)
<hi>The Engli≈øhmens God makes us afraid here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As long as they enjoyed their fir≈øt Government, no Enemies could
≈øtand before them; but ≈øince that they have not been able to ≈øubdue an
hundred Indians, who did the la≈øt year commit ≈øome outrages among them,
having been (as I am credibly in≈øormed) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øignedly provoked thereunto by
≈øome Injuries done unto them by tho≈øe then in Power, who intended the Ruine
of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh, and Advancement of the French Intere≈øt in that
Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
            <p>As for your Enquiry, <hi>By what means they came to be deprived of
their Charters, Rights and Liberties;</hi> plea≈øe to under≈øtand, that in
the year 1683, a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> was i≈ø≈øued out again≈øt them, and
with the Notification thereof by the then King's Order there was a Declaration
publi≈øhed, enjoyning tho≈øe few particular Per≈øons men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the
<hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> to make their defence at their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Charge,
without any help by a publick Stock: By this it was ea≈øie to ≈øee that
≈øome Per≈øons were re≈øolv'd to have the Charters condemned, <hi>quo jure
quaque injuria:</hi> Neverthele≈øs, the Governor and Company appointed an
Attorney to appear, and an≈øwer to the <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> in the Court of
King's Bench.</p>
            <p>The Pro≈øecutors not being able to make any thing of it there, a
new Suit was Commenced by a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> in the High Court of
Chancery.</p>
            <p>But tho they had not ≈øufficient time given them to make their
Defence, yet Judgment was entred again≈øt them for Default in not appearing;
when it was impo≈ø≈øible, con≈øidering the remote di≈øtance of <hi>New
England</hi> from <hi>Westmin≈øter-hall,</hi> that they ≈øhould appear in the
time allowed.</p>
            <p>Thus illegally was the Charter of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øets</hi>
Colony wre≈øted from them: as for the Colonies of <hi>Plymouth,
Conecticot,</hi> and <hi>Road I≈øland,</hi> there was never any Judgment
again≈øt them, nor any Surrender; but by a mere Rape, in the year 1686, their
Charters and Priviledges were violently taken from them.</p>
            <p>Since that time the Country hath mightily declined, and gone to
ruin daily, not being now like the place it was Five Years ago, which is not
much to be wondred at, con≈øidering the Intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101219:4"/>Oppre≈ø≈øions they have been Labouring under, ≈øince their Charters
were Ravi≈øhed from them.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1686. <hi>Sir Edmond Andros,</hi> was ≈øent by the
late King <hi>James</hi> to <hi>New England;</hi> with a Commi≈ø≈øion
ab≈øolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructive to the fundamentals of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi>
Government, Impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering him with Four more (none of them cho≈øen by the
People) to Levy Money, and make Laws, nay, and in ca≈øe of War in the
Plantations to ≈øend as many of the Inhabitants as he would, two Thou≈øand
Miles out of the Country: This Commi≈ø≈øion being Illegal and ≈øo in it
≈øelf void, the People not being able to Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue longer under tho≈øe
Oppre≈ø≈øions, did this la≈øt Spring a≈ø≈øert their Engli≈øh Liberties,
Rights and Priviledges, and Unanimou≈øly Declare for <hi>the Prince of Orange,
and the Parliament of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is greatly to be ob≈øerved, that as long as <hi>New
England</hi> enjoyed their Charters for more than Fifty Years together, they
never put the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to a Penny Charge; which is more than
can be ≈øaid of any other Forreign Plantations depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ≈øince they have been under a Government not by
<hi>Charters,</hi> but by <hi>Commi≈ø≈øion,</hi> the Country hath been
Chargeable, and le≈øs Beneficial to the Kings Revenue than in former
times.</p>
            <p>It hath indeed been objected, that in <hi>New England</hi> they
did many Years a go Tran≈øgre≈øs <hi>the Act of Navigation.</hi> But the
Tra≈øgre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ≈øome few particular Per≈øons ought not to be charged
as the fault of the Government there, who did in the Year 1663, make a Law that
the Act of Navigation ≈øhould be Strictly ob≈øerved, and their Governours are
Sworn to ≈øee that Law Executed, and have to the uttermo≈øt of their power
been careful therein.</p>
            <p>Many other Things have been ≈øugge≈øted again≈øt <hi>New
England,</hi> he mo≈øt of which having no foot≈øteps of Truth in them, but
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Malicious Inventions of the <hi>Tobijahs</hi> and
<hi>Sanballats</hi> of the Age, are not worth mentioning.</p>
            <p>Not but the People there being but Men, have had their failings as
well as other Men in all places of the World. The only thing (≈øo far as I can
learn) which can with any Coluor of Truth be ju≈øtly reflected on them as a
great fault, is that in ≈øome matters relating to Con≈øcience and difference
of opinion, they have been more rigid and ≈øevere than the Primitive
Chri≈øtians or the Go≈øpel doth allow of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:101219:5"/>Yet this is to be ≈øaid in their behalf, that
things are reported wor≈øe than indeed they were, and that now many Leading
Men, and the generality of the People are of a more moderate Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>I know many that have a great Intere≈øt there, do abhor the
Spirit of Per≈øecution as much as any Men in the World.</p>
            <p>It is certainly for the Intere≈øt of <hi>England,</hi> that
<hi>New England</hi> be incouraged; and pre≈øerved in all their Rights,
Priviledges and Properties, and tho≈øe ill Men who have given or ≈øhall give
contrary advice (notwith≈øtanding all their vain pretences to the contrary)
have and will prejudice the Intere≈øt of the Crown more than they are, or ever
were, or can be able to make amends for: which I evince by the Arguments
following.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The Kings Revenue, all things con≈øidered, is as much or
more augmented by <hi>New England,</hi> than by any other of the Foreign
Plantations. This will ≈øeem to ≈øome a ≈øtrange A≈ø≈øertion: But
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider what I ≈øay, and then judge if it be not true.
<p>The other <hi>American Plantations</hi> cannot well
≈øub≈øi≈øt without <hi>New England;</hi> which is by a Thou≈øand Leagues
nearer to them than either <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland;</hi> ≈øo that
they are ≈øupplied with Provi≈øions, Beef, Pork, Meal, Fi≈øh, &amp;c. And
al≈øo with the Lumber Trade, Deal Boards, Pipe-Staves, &amp;c. chiefly from
<hi>New England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Al≈øo the <hi>Carribbe I≈ølands</hi> have theire Hor≈øes
from thence. It is then in a greater part by means of <hi>New England</hi> that
the other Plantations are made pro≈øperous and beneficial; they pay Cu≈øtoms
in the Plantations for the Goods they Export from thence into <hi>New
England,</hi> and when tho≈øe Goods are brought into <hi>England,</hi> they
pay the ≈øame again the Second time, by which means not a little is
contributed to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>Some Manufactures there are among≈øt them, but not a
Twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth part of what the Country hath need of, or is con≈øumed there,
mo≈øt of their Cloathing as to Woollen and Linnen, all ≈øorts of Uphol≈øtery
Wares, Haberda≈øhers and Silk Wares, Stuffs, Silks, &amp;c. they have from
<hi>England;</hi> and make returns in Plate, Pieces of Eight, Beaver, Moo≈øe
and Deer Skins, Oyl, and Iron, all which, but the Bullion, the Country
affords.</p>
                  <p>Al≈øo by Sugars and Tobacco, Indico, and indeed all the
Product<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101219:5"/>of the other Plantations, which with their own
Ve≈ø≈øels they fetch and tran≈øport to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
               </item>
               <item>II. I know not whether in the World there be a better place
for ≈øhipping, nor can I ≈øay how many, (but many hundreds there are)
hundreds of Ve≈ø≈øels of their own building do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Country,
(be≈øides great Numbers built and ≈øold into <hi>England,</hi>) for they
yearly build many good Ships, ≈øome of which for <hi>London,</hi> and other
places in <hi>England.</hi>
                  <p>The Country abounds with Pine-Trees, Excellent Cedars, and Oak
for building of Ships, and Ship-Ma≈øts in abundance; by tho≈øe that are
proper Judges, the be≈øt in the World, and come yearly from thence for the
U≈øe of the King's Ships.</p>
                  <p>And it hath been affirmed by knowing Men in Navigation and
Building, that whenever the King of <hi>England</hi> plea≈øes, he may in
<hi>New England</hi> on ≈øuch ea≈øie Rates as is ≈øcarce imaginable, build
Navies of Ships: There being no better Timber in the World, and in ≈øuch
quantities as are inexhau≈øtible, and in ≈øuch convenient Places, as if God
and Nature had adapted the≈øe va≈øt Timbers for the ≈øaid u≈øe; which is
worth con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for that Timber is generally wanting in
<hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Ireland;</hi> what is, is too far from Waters and
Places fit for Carriage, and the Ea≈øt-Land Oak is ≈øpungy and
unfit.</p>
               </item>
               <item>III. The Engli≈øh born in <hi>New England,</hi> have the
true inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Spirit of the <hi>Old,</hi> apt and fit for Martial Employs; and
as an addition to their Natural Courage and Sobriety, are well in≈øtructed in
Martial Di≈øcipline.</item>
            </list>
            <p>All the Inhabitants from ≈øixteen to ≈øixty Years in each Town,
are by the Law and con≈øtant Cu≈øtom of the Country to bear Arms, if
occa≈øion ≈øhall require, and that they may be fit ≈øo to do,</p>
            <p>They have in each Town and Village their Training-days, eight
Times every Year, wherein they are exerci≈øed in Military Di≈øcipline, that
≈øo they may be expert in War, on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, for their own Defence, and
Service of their Prince; who will find whenever he ≈øhall plea≈øe for to
command, and commi≈ø≈øionate them, that they are able (by the Ble≈ø≈øing of
God) to ≈øecure and enlarge his Dominions, and to bring<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101219:6"/>their French Neighbours into an intire Subjection to the Crown of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from this Con≈øideration it was, that the French
Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters, (who all the World knows had a mighty A≈øcendent over
<hi>White-Hall,</hi> in the Two Late Kings Reigns) cea≈øed not in their
Negotiations, until among≈øt other Articles agreed on; One was, that in Ca≈øe
of a War betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> there ≈øhall be a
Neutrality in the Plantations: They wi≈øely fore≈øeeing, that if the King of
<hi>England,</hi> ≈øhould arm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion his Subjects in <hi>New
England,</hi> the Frenchmen in tho≈øe parts could not ≈øtand before them.</p>
            <p>In the Time of the Late Protector <hi>Cromwel,</hi> they did by
order from <hi>England,</hi> take ≈øeveral Forts from the French, which by
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second were re≈øtored to them again; no ways to the
Honour or Intere≈øt of the Engli≈øh Nation.</p>
            <p>And it's hoped, His Maje≈øty and the High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
will put that value upon <hi>New England,</hi> as ≈øo va≈øt a Tract of Land
and Body of People de≈øerve from a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on which they depend, and are
≈øo great and u≈øeful a Member, as they have manife≈øted them≈øelves to be:
And that in ≈øo Eminent a manner as calls for Protection, Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and
Re≈øtauration to all their Rights, Priviledges and Proprieties, and what
Additions more, as in His Maje≈øty great Wi≈ødom, ≈øhall be thought fit for
his Service, the Prote≈øtant Religion and the good of that People; who on the
18th. of <hi>April,</hi> 1689. Unanimou≈øly ro≈øe in Arms, and after having
≈øei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed upon their Illegal Governour, and the re≈øt of their
Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øors; declared for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the
Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> the Prote≈øtant Religion and their Ancient
Con≈øtitution, and to this day do keep the Country for our Pre≈øent
Sovereigns, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> again≈øt King
<hi>Lewis,</hi> and the Abdicated King <hi>James,</hi> waiting His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øties
Commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Declaration is in the words following:
<q>WE do therefore ≈øeize upon the Per≈øons of tho≈øe few
<hi>Ill Men,</hi> which have (been next unto our<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101219:6"/>≈øins) the
Grand Authors of our Mi≈øeries, re≈øolving to ≈øecure them, for what
Ju≈øtice, Orders from his Highne≈øs, with the Engli≈øh Parliament ≈øhall
direct, le≈øt, e're we are aware, we find (what we may fear, being on all
≈øides in danger) our ≈øelves to be by them given away to a Foreign
<hi>Power,</hi> before ≈øuch Orders can reach unto us, for which Orders we now
humbly wait; in the mean time firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that we have endeavoured
nothing but what meer Duty to God and our Country calls for at our hands: We
commit our Enterprize to the <hi>Ble≈ø≈øing</hi> of him, <hi>who hears the
Cry of the oppre≈ø≈øed,</hi> and advi≈øe all our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for whom we
have thus ventured our ≈øelves, to joyn with us in Prayers, and all ju≈øt
Actions for the Defence of the Land.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The twelfth Article of <hi>New England</hi> is the Key of the
<hi>New World America;</hi> if the French King had got it into his
Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, he might ≈øoon have made him≈øelf Ma≈øter of
<hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> and this in all Probability would have been done this
Summer, if the <hi>New Englanders</hi> in and about <hi>Bo≈øton,</hi>
pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating into the De≈øigns carrying on, had not ri≈øen as one Man, and
≈øeized Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> (who is as of a French Extract, ≈øo in the French
Intere≈øts; being ≈øent to <hi>New England</hi> by the Late King
<hi>James,</hi> with an Illegal and Arbitrary Commi≈ø≈øion) and tho≈øe ill
Men who joyned with him in his Tyranny.</p>
            <p>All men do acknowledge, that tho≈øe brave Souls whom God hath
≈øo wonderfully a≈ø≈øi≈øted, and ≈øpirited to pre≈øerve
<hi>London-Derry,</hi> (and perhaps thereby to ≈øave all <hi>Ireland</hi>) by
≈øecuring it, and declaring for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
de≈øerve great Favour and Protection from the Government.</p>
            <p>And the ≈øame mu≈øt be acknowledged due unto the People of
<hi>New England,</hi> and more e≈øpecially, when it is con≈øidered of what
Value and Con≈øequence to <hi>England, New England</hi> is, and that they ≈øo
early as it were, re≈øcued the Country out of the hands of the French, even
before they knew the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was King of <hi>England,</hi>
and that at a Time when they<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101219:7"/>knew no more, than that His
Highne≈øs was landed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with a de≈øign to endeavour the
delivering the Kingdom, and the Churches of God from Popery, Slavery and
Arbitrary Power, which as they lookt upon as an Heroick and Glorious
Undertaking; ≈øo they al≈øo accounted it their Duty to embark them≈øelves in
the ≈øame Cau≈øe; though they knew not what the I≈ø≈øue of ≈øo mighty a
Work would be; which hath cau≈øed ≈øome Per≈øons of no Mean Figure to ≈øay,

<q>The≈øe People de≈øerve His Maje≈øties and the Nations
Re≈øpect, Countenance, and Speedy Re≈øtitution of all their Rights, and to be
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by His Maje≈øties Commi≈ø≈øions to pro≈øecute the War again≈øt
<hi>France</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> which they are capable to do without any
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable Charge to the Government.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed <hi>New England,</hi> hath upon the be≈øt Accounts
which can be mentioned, out-done all <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For there they have erected an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>niver≈øity,</hi> which
began in the year 1642, wherein things are managed, <hi>pro more Academia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
in Anglia:</hi> Several Per≈øons of more than ordinary Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yea, and
many ≈øcores of able Mini≈øters, of the Go≈øpel, have there had their
Education.</p>
            <p>There by the Statutes of the <hi>Colledge,</hi> none is to be
admitted, before he can write Latin in a pure Style, and tran≈ølate any
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Greek Author.</p>
            <p>It is cu≈øtomary with them, every Morning in the Colledge-Hall,
to read a Chapter out of the Hebrew Bible, and at Night a Chapter out of the
Greek Original.</p>
            <p>The Tutors there in≈øtruct their Pupils in <hi>Logick, Natural
and Moral Philo≈øophy, Metaphy≈øicks, Geography, A≈øtronomy, Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,

Patent was Ratified to them by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Fir≈øt and Second,

            <p>Nay, I will be bold to ≈øay, that <hi>New England</hi> hath

But no le≈øs than Four and twenty of tho≈øe Heathens, are now not only

≈øet him≈øelf to learn the<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101219:9"/>Indian Tongue, that he might the
more ea≈øily, and ≈øucce≈øsfully open to them the My≈øteries of the
Go≈øpel; on account of which he hath been (not unde≈øervedly) called <hi>the
Apostle of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Indians.</hi> This Reverend Per≈øon was he that, with
indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable Labour and Study, tran≈ølated the whole Bible into the Indian
Tongue, and al≈øo ≈øeveral Engli≈øh Treati≈øes of Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Divinity and
Catechi≈øms.</p>
            <p>About Twenty eight years ≈øince he gathered a Church of Converted
Indians, in a Town called <hi>Natick.</hi> The≈øe poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were brought
to ≈øuch a ≈øen≈øe of God and Religion, that they confe≈ø≈øed their Sins
with Tears, and profe≈ø≈øed their Faith in Chri≈øt; and afterwards they and
their Children were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and they were Solemnly joyned together in a
Church-Covenant: And Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> was the fir≈øt that Admini≈øtred the
Lords Supper to them. The Mini≈øter of that Church is now an Indian named
<hi>Daniel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be≈øides this Church at <hi>Natick,</hi> among our Inhabitants in
the Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øets Colony, there are Four <hi>Indian</hi> A≈ø≈øemblies;
where the Name of the True God, and Je≈øus Chri≈øt, is ≈øolemnly called
upon. And the≈øe Four A≈ø≈øemblies have American Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: Mr.
<hi>Elliot</hi> formerly Preached to them once in Fourteen Days; but now being
Weakned with his Labours, and in the Eighty Sixth Year of his Age, doth not
Preach to them more than once in Two Months.</p>
            <p>About Fifty Miles from <hi>Bo≈øton</hi> is another Church
con≈øi≈øting only of Converted Indians; in an Indian Town, called
<hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhippang,</hi> the fir≈øt Mini≈øter of which was an Engli≈øhman,
who being skilful in the <hi>American Language,</hi> Preached the Go≈øpel to
them in their own Tongue; but this Mini≈øter is lately Dead, and they now have
an Indian Preacher.</p>
            <p>There are be≈øides that, Five A≈ø≈øemblies of Indians
profe≈ø≈øing the Name of Chri≈øt, not far di≈øtant from
<hi>Mar≈øhippang,</hi> which have Indian Preachers, and al≈øo are Preached
unto in their own Language once every weak by Mr. <hi>John Cotton,</hi> Son of
the Famous Mr. <hi>John Cotton,</hi> ≈øomtimes Mini≈øter of the Church at
<hi>Bo≈øton.</hi> In <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony of the Inhabitants of
<hi>Saconet</hi> there is a great Congregation of tho≈øe who for
di≈øtinctions ≈øake, are called <hi>Praying Indians;</hi> Becau≈øe they Pray
to God in Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:101219:9"/>Not far from a Promontory called <hi>Cape
Cod,</hi> are Six A≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Heathens who are to be reckoned as
<hi>Catechumeni;</hi> among≈øt whom are Six Indian Preachers. Mr. <hi>Samuel
Treat</hi> Mini≈øter of a Church at <hi>Ea≈øt Ham,</hi> Preacheth to the≈øe
Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in their own Language.</p>
            <p>There are among≈øt the I≈ølanders of <hi>Mantucket,</hi> a
Church, with a Mini≈øter who was lately a Heathen, and ≈øeveral meetings of
<hi>Catechumeni,</hi> who are in≈øtructed by the Converted Indians.</p>
            <p>In the I≈øland of <hi>Martha,</hi> which is about Twenty Two
Miles long, are two American Churches planted, which are more Famous than the
re≈øt, for that over one of them pre≈øides an Ancient Indian Mini≈øter,
called <hi>Hiacooms: John Hiacooms,</hi> Son of the ≈øaid Indian Mini≈øter,
al≈øo Preaches the Go≈øpel to his Contrymen in
<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Church: in that place <hi>John
Tockino≈øh,</hi> a Converted Indian Teaches.</p>
            <p>In the≈øe Churches <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> of the Indians are
joyned to the Mini≈øters: The Mini≈øters were cho≈øen by the People, and
when they had Fa≈øted and Prayed, Mr. <hi>Elliott</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>
laid their hands on them, ≈øo that they were ≈øolemnly Ordained.</p>
            <p>All the Congregations of the Converted Indians, (the
<hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumeni</hi> and tho≈øe that are in Church-Order) every Lords Day
meet together, the Mini≈øter always beginning with Prayer, and without a Form,
becau≈øe from the heart; when the Ruler of the A≈ø≈øembly hath ended his
Prayer, the whole Cogregation of Indians, prai≈øe God with Singing; in which
many of them are excelling. After the P≈øalm, he that Preaches reads a place
of Scripture, and Expounds it, gathers Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins from it, proves them by
Scripture and rea≈øons, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers u≈øe from them after the manner of the
Engli≈øh, of whom they have been taught: Then another Prayer to God in the
Name of Chri≈øt concludes the whole Service, in which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they meet twice
every Lord's Day; they ob≈øerve no Holy Days, but the Lord's Day, except upon
≈øome extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion; and then they ≈øolemnly ≈øet apart whole
Days, either in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thanks, or fa≈øting and praying with great fervor of
Mind.</p>
            <p>Before the Engli≈øh came into the≈øe Parts, the≈øe Barbarous
Nations were altogether ignorant of the true God; hence it is, that in their
Prayers and Sermons, they u≈øe Engli≈øh Words and Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:101219:10"/>He that calls upon the mo≈øt Holy Name of
God, ≈øays, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or God, or Lord; and al≈øo they have Learned,
and borrowed many other Theological Phra≈øes from the Engli≈øh.</p>
            <p>There are ≈øix Churches of Baptized Indians in <hi>New
England,</hi> and eighteen A≈ø≈øemblies of <hi>Catechumeni,</hi>
profe≈ø≈øing the Name of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Of the Indians there are four and twenty who are Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the
Word of God, and there are al≈øo four Engli≈øh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters who Preach the
Go≈øpel in the Indian Tongue, and there are many of the Indians Children, who
have learned by heart the Catechi≈øm; either of that ≈øamous Divine Mr.

the que≈øtions in it.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir I have endeavoured to gratifie your reque≈øt with as
much Brevity as the Subject will admit, and exceeding the Bounds of a Letter,
am forced to be ≈øo prolix, and the rather for that mo≈øt of what I have
written is upon my own knowledge, Truth (and the re≈øt undeniable fact) though
not the twentieth Part of the Truths might be ≈øaid of the Almighty's mo≈øt
won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ble≈ø≈øing and pro≈øpering <hi>New England,</hi> and his Go≈øpel
among the Heathen there, which to me looks like the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the
fulfilling tho≈øe many Prophecies in <hi>Holy Writ</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them.</p>
            <p>And after all this, I cannot but admire there ≈øhould be (as you
≈øay there is) any Man in <hi>England,</hi> who owns but even the bare name of
a Prote≈øtant, at ≈øuch a time as this, when God ≈øeems to have begun the
Reformation of the whole World, and eminently to appear for the True Reformed
Religion, ≈øhould be an Enemy unto ≈øuch a People as are in <hi>New
England,</hi> and their Di≈øcipline, as to the Religious Wor≈øhip: When as to
all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unprejudiced per≈øons, its con≈øonant to the practice of the
Primitive Church, and of the Reformed Churches through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World: Which one
would think ≈øhould not find an Enemy among any ≈øort of Chri≈øtians, but
tho≈øe called Papi≈øts, or el≈øe among ≈øuch, as <hi>Papi≈øt like</hi> can
give up their Religion, Rights, Liberties, and Properties, nay, their very
